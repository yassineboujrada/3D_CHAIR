# 3D Chair Animation with Color Change using React.js and Three.js

This project is a 3D chair animation that allows you to change its color using React.js and Three.js. It provides an interactive interface where users can view a 3D model of a chair and modify its color in real-time.

## Features :

- 3D Chair Model: The project includes a high-quality 3D chair model that can be rotated and zoomed in/out for a better view.

- Color Change: Users can change the color of the chair by selecting from a predefined set of colors or entering a custom color value.

- Real-time Rendering: The chair color changes are rendered in real-time, providing an interactive and responsive user experience.

- React.js Integration: The project utilizes the React.js library to build the user interface and manage component-based architecture.

- Three.js Integration: Three.js is used for creating and rendering the 3D chair model, handling camera movements, and applying color changes.
